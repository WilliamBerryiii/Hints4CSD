Interfaces capture minimum requirements of an abstraction
Don't generalize, generalizations are generally wrong</p>

<h3>Corollaries</h3>

<p>Build basic interfaces that are blazing fast
How do we know it's fast? Telemetry &amp; Logging
"... it is normal for 80% of the time to be spent in 20% of the code, but a priori analysis or intuition usually can’t find the 20% with any certainty." - Lampson</p>

<p>Keep basic interfaces stable 
"When a system grows to more than 250K lines of code the amount of change becomes intolerable; even when there is no doubt about what has to be done, it takes too long to do it. There is no choice but to break the system into smaller pieces related only by interfaces that are stable for years."</p>
