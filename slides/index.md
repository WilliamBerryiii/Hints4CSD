- title : Hints for Computer System Design
- description : While technologies, methodologies and abstractions have waxed and waned over the years, Butler Lampson’s ‘Hints for Computer Systems Design’ remains relevant to the current challenges faced in software and hardware systems engineering.  Drawing against the backdrop of current development practices, we will discuss how Lampson’s hints can still be used, some thirty years later, to implement functionally accurate, high-performing fault-tolerant software systems.
